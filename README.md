INKENTRA
=======
**Inkentra** is a video sharing/chatting application(similar to WhatsApp/Zoom) using WebRTC feature.  I used [Open-EasyRTC](https://github.com/open-easyrtc/open-easyrtc) open source application and add/modify functionality according to the **Inkentra** application requirements.

**Inkentra** will be supporting one-2-one video calling and chatting as basic features. I will update the features as and when planned.
